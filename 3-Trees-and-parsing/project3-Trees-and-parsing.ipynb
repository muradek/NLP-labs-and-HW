        "In practice, we want to work with grammars that cover nearly all the language we expect to come across for a given application. This leads to an explosion of rules and a large number of possible parses for any one sentence. To remove ambiguity between the different parses, it's desirable to move to probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFG). In this part of the assignment, you will construct a PCFG from training data, parse using a probabilistic version of CKY, and evaluate the quality of the resulting parses against gold trees.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Part 4: PCFG construction\n",
        "\n",
        "Compared to CFGs, PCFGs need to assign probabilities to grammar rules. For this goal, you'll write a function `pcfg_from_trees` that takes a list of strings describing a corpus of trees and returns an NLTK PCFG trained on that set of trees.\n",

        "\n",
        "We want the PCFG to be in CNF format because the probabilistic version of CKY that you'll implement next also requires the grammar to be in CNF. However, the gold trees are not in CNF form, so in this case you will need to convert the gold *trees* to CNF before building the PCFG from them. To accomplish this, you should use the `treetransforms` package from `nltk`, which includes functions for converting to and from CNF. In particular, you'll want to make use of `treetransforms.collapse_unary` followed by `treetransforms.chomsky_normal_form` to convert a tree to its binarized version. You can then get the counts for all of the productions used in the trees, and then normalize them to probabilities so that the probabilities of all rules with the same left-hand side sum to 1.\n",

Then make sure to add the file to your git commit. Please name the file the same name as this notebook, but with a `.pdf` extension.
